# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

## Project Overview:

In this project, you will explore and experiment with the training of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate images similar to the MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to gain practical experience in deep learning, specifically in GANs, by conducting a series of experiments using your preferred deep learning framework (Tensorflow, PyTorch, or Keras). We will utilize Weights and Biases to track and visualize the progress of these experiments.
