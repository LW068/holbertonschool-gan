## Description:

a type of artificial neural network used in unsupervised learning. Comprising two sub-networks—a Generator and a Discriminator—GANs engage in a cat-and-mouse game where the Generator strives to create realistic data while the Discriminator endeavors to distinguish real from fake. This dynamic interplay leads to the generation of incredibly lifelike data, unlocking a wide array of applications from image generation to data augmentation.
