# Advanced GAN Experimentation for Complex Image Generation

## Project Overview:

In this advanced project, you will build upon your knowledge gained from the DCGAN MNIST project and dive into more complex challenges. Your task is to explore and experiment with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating images for a more complex dataset. You have the flexibility to choose between projects like Celebrity Face Generation or Super-Resolution GANs. The project will continue to use your preferred deep learning framework (Tensorflow, PyTorch, or Keras) and Weights and Biases for tracking your experiments.
