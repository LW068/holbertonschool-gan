# Advanced GAN Experimentation for Complex Image Generation

## Project Overview:

In this advanced project, you will build upon your knowledge gained from the DCGAN MNIST project and dive into more complex challenges. Your task is to explore and experiment with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating images for a more complex dataset. You have the flexibility to choose between projects like Celebrity Face Generation or Super-Resolution GANs. The project will continue to use your preferred deep learning framework (Tensorflow, PyTorch, or Keras) and Weights and Biases for tracking your experiments.

# Advanced GAN Project Structure

This repository is organized to support the development and tracking of the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) model for generating images.

## Directory Structure

- `HolbertonSchoolAdvancedGAN.ipynb`: This single Google Colab notebook contains the entire project's workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured to reflect the components of a typical GAN project repository:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The initial sections of the notebook are dedicated to loading the dataset directly into the Colab environment and preprocessing it to suit the needs of our DCGAN model.

- **Model Definitions**: Following the data section, the notebook defines the GAN architecture, including separate sections for the generator and discriminator models.

- **Training Loop**: The core of the notebook is the training loop, where the GAN model is trained over several epochs, and intermediary results are displayed to track the model's progress.

- **Logs and Metrics**: Throughout the training process, key metrics such as loss and accuracy are logged for both the generator and discriminator. These logs are essential for monitoring the model's performance and tuning it for better results.

- **Experiments**: The notebook also documents various experiments conducted, including changes to model architecture, hyperparameters, and training procedures. Each experiment is clearly marked and explained.

- **Utilities**: Utility functions and classes are defined within the notebook to support various tasks such as image generation, model saving/loading, and more.

- **Configuration**: At the top of the notebook, configurations are set for the entire project, which includes hyperparameters, model parameters, training settings, etc.They may also be found in some parts of the notbeook.
